\item Packages in this repo are assumed to manage their own documentation.
\item The documentation for each package is generated using doxygen.
\item To generate this documentation, please roscd to the package and run {\ttfamily doxygen Doxyfile} ,if a Doxyfile exists.
\item All the packages are assumed to have the H\+T\+ML documentation generated in the {\ttfamily docs} folder of the package, and not in {\ttfamily docs/html} of the package.
\item Run {\ttfamily python3 combine\+\_\+docs.\+py} to copy all the documentation from the {\ttfamily docs} folder of each package to the {\ttfamily docs} folder of the workspace. In the docs folder of the workspace, each package\textquotesingle{}s documentation is stored in a folder with the package name.
\item For any packages with documentation which you want to include in the final website, please add the package name and link to it\textquotesingle{}s index.\+html file in the Sub Modules section of this file. Basic syntax is as follows\+: {\ttfamily $\ast$ $<$a href=\char`\"{}package\+\_\+name/index.\+html\char`\"{}$>$package\+\_\+name$<$/a$>$}
\item Once this is done, run {\ttfamily doxygen Doxyfile} in the workspace folder to generate the documentation for the workspace.
\item Git Push the changes to the docs branch of the repo, this triggers a rebuild of the website.
\item Disclaimer \+: The combine\+\_\+docs.\+py script has been taken from chatgpt.
