This package contains the nodes that are responsible for publishing the current velocity and target velocity to the arduino. The arduino then uses this information to control the motors. The arduino also publishes the encoder information to the R\+PI, which is then used to calculate the current velocity and wheel odometry.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{This package contains the following nodes\+:}\label{index_autotoc_md1}

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Curr\+\_\+\+Vel\+\_\+node \+: This node opens a serial tty port and publishes velocity information on the topic /\+C\+U\+R\+R\+\_\+\+V\+EL and wheel odometry info on /\+C\+U\+R\+R\+\_\+\+O\+D\+OM. This runs in an isolated core of the R\+PI for real time performance.
\item Target\+\_\+\+Publisher\+\_\+\+Node\+: This node subscribes to /\+T\+A\+R\+G\+\_\+\+V\+EL topic, and in the callback, publishes the target velocity to an serial tty port talking to the arduino. This runs in an isolated core of the R\+PI for real time performance.
\item Both of these nodes are written in C++, any other nodes present have been deprecated.
